# Valhalla
Social networking service

### Tech
Valhalla uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) - Declarative routing for React.
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A Predictable State Container for JS Apps.
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) - Thunk middleware for Redux.

And of course Valhalla itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/seryozhabaleyko/netflix-clone) on GitHub.
